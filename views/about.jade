							h3 Frogs. They don't get tech.
							p 
								| What would happen if a bunch of frogs got together to start a technology company? This web comic
								| looks to answer that question, as well as many other deep questions that linger in the minds of
								| anyone who's ever used the Internet.
							p No, seriously.
							p
								| Okay, maybe it's just a bunch of silly puns inside speech balloons attached to the mouths of cartoon frogs
								| that veil a deep and thought-provoking commentary on our modern culture. It might be satire. It might just be absurd.
							p
								| Whatever it is, it is definitely a web comic designed to use the full power of the web as a medium. It's not just
								| a print comic on a web page. It's HTML5, CSS, JS, SVG, and a bunch of other acronyms. <a href="http://thoughts.amphibian.com">And you can
								| read more about the technology that I use to create it here.</a>
							p New comics are currently published every Wednesday, but some deviations from that schedule might occur from time to time. Check back often.
